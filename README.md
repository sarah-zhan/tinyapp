## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcryptjs
- cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

### Goal
This four-day project will have you building a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

You will build an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way you'll get introduced to some more advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, and you'll also learn more about Express, a web framework which is very popular in the Node community.

### Project Outcome
You will build a simple multipage app:

with authentication protection
that reacts appropriately to the user's logged-in state,
and permits the user to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) a simple entity (e.g. blog posts, URL shortener).

### User Stories
As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

As a twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.

(Stretch) As an avid twitter poster,
I want to be able to see how many times my subscribers visit my links
so that I can learn what content they like.

### Project Requirements (Details in Compass)
#### Problem Decomposition
#### Code Organization
#### Code Readability
#### Functional Requirements
#### Source Code Version Control

### Additional Requirements
Site Header:
if a user is logged in, the header shows:
the user's email
a logout button which makes a POST request to /logout
if a user is not logged in, the header shows:
a link to the login page (/login)
a link to the registration page (/register)

* GET /urls/:id

if user is logged in and owns the URL for the given ID:
returns HTML with:
the site header (see Display Requirements above)
the short URL (for the given ID)
a form which contains:
the corresponding long URL
an update button which makes a POST request to /urls/:id
(Stretch) the date the short URL was created
(Stretch) the number of times the short URL was visited
(Stretch) the number of unique visits for the short URL
if a URL for the given ID does not exist:
(Minor) returns HTML with a relevant error message
if user is not logged in:
returns HTML with a relevant error message
if user is logged it but does not own the URL with the given ID:
returns HTML with a relevant error message

* GET /u/:id

if URL for the given ID exists:
redirects to the corresponding long URL
if URL for the given ID does not exist:
(Minor) returns HTML with a relevant error message
POST /urls

if user is logged in:
generates a short URL, saves it, and associates it with the user
redirects to /urls/:id, where :id matches the ID of the newly saved URL
